Initially the firewall rules make it so that windows automatically disables port 23.
The windows defender firewall can be accessed by using the start menu.
Then the user will have to go and enable both port 23 by setting custom rules for both outbound and inbound traffic.
It should be understood that for telnet to run it requires a server that is hosting telnet. For most PCs this is not common.
If you dont have telnet access proceed to Pragma Solutions and downbload their telent server
Once this has been completed proceed to apply the firewall rules and then setup the server.
Then using a virtual machine iw ill proceed to connect to the self hosted telnet server
After this it can be seen that connection is made possible and that the activity is completed.
Before wrapping it is necessary to revert all the steps back to original state (that is having port 23 disabled).
